:h base-directories for information on nvim's config and data directories
:h api for info on the neovim api  

something that could be a pain in the bum: if telescopes ripgrep command is wrong, telescope fails silently.(it just displays no results)

I have learned:
Please Read That Friendly Manual. A number of times I have wasted lots of time on youtube searching for things like "how to make this plugin do this" only to eventually find that it is a very well documented(and simple) process when I eventually sit and dedicate some time to read the manual. Note to self and perhaps a tip to fellow neovim enjoyers somehow reading this, :help <plugin whose behaviour I wish to modify> much more often. Telescope help_tags is very useful here as it allows me to fuzzy search plugin manuals, allowing me to find specific things in the manuals when I don't know what they are precisely named

deep dives are super valuable. eg. Deeply learn about the diagnostics api over a weekend. I have found that this allows me to have fine grained control. I think about some cool thing I want my beautiful neovim to do, and I find that I have an idea of how to make that happen(things I would have sought a whole plugin to fix for me, may be achievable with a few lines of lua if I understand what's going on better)
